# 5G Utilities

Welcome to the 5G Utilities repository! This project is designed to provide tools and programs that assist in understanding and optimizing 5G technology. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional in the field of telecommunications, these utilities can help you calculate key metrics such as data throughput, spectral efficiency, and more.

## Features

This repository includes the following utilities:

- **Data Throughput Calculator**: Calculate the theoretical maximum throughput of a 5G connection based on various network parameters.
- **Spectral Efficiency Measurement**: Measure and evaluate the spectral efficiency of different 5G configurations.
- **Link Budget Calculator**: Estimate the link budget for 5G networks to assess potential communication range and quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with these utilities, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/5G.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the utility you want to use:
   ```bash
   cd 5G/ThroughputCalculator
   ```
3. Follow the specific instructions in the utility's folder to run the program.

## Prerequisites

Before you run any of the utilities, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Necessary Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib` (Install using `pip install numpy matplotlib`)
